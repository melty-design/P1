                    <!--Born in Rockford, Illinois (U.S.A.) in 1980, Virgil Abloh is an artist, architect, and fashion designer. After earning a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he obtained a
                    master’s degree in Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology.<br>It was at the Illinois Institute of Technology where Abloh was introduced to a curriculum established by Mies van der Rohe, formed from the notions of Bauhaus, that taught him to combine the fields of art, craft and design. These theories, merged with contemporary culture, make up Abloh’s inter-disciplinary practice today.-->
                    Below please find a resource center for brands in their earliest phases. This resource was born as I was working to summarize answers to all my most frequently asked questions. The goal of this resource is to uplift more than a few. I will continue to open doors for those that come from the fringe and help them be awarded opportunities usually left for the center.<br>This continued commitment is supported by the “Post-Modern” Scholarship foundation, with its mission statement being to supply black students an education in fashion via fundraising and mentorship in partnership with the Fashion Scholarship Foundation.
